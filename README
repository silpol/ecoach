Building
--------

To compile eCoach, you need the set up the Scratcbhox. For more
information on this, please see documentation at
	- http://maemo.org/
	- http://scratchbox.org/

This software also uses GOB2 (see http://www.5z.com/jirka/gob.html) for
easing the subclassing of GObjects. Unfortunately GOB2 isn't readily available
in the package management of the scratchbox. I recommend that you install
it to your host system, and then compile the .gob files with following
commands in the source directory (that is usually something like
/scratchbox/users/<your-user-name>/home/<your-user-name>/ecoach/src):
gob2 ec-progress.gob
gob2 ec-button.gob

When you have scratcbox installed and the sources unpacked, please do the
following:

1) Go to the source directory (e.g., "cd ecoach" or something like that)

2) Type the command
autoreconf --install
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
	OR if you downloaded the software using svn

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -I.svn


Maintenance
-----------
