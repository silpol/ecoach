2008-05-25  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Removed executable permission from gconf_keys.h, that for some
	  reason was there

2008-05-25  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Changed version number to 1.0-2
	* Define _POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE in configure.ac
	* Include config.h from all headers
	* Fixed compiler warnings from MapWidget
	* Added function to clear track from MapWidget
	* Clear track from MapWidget when starting a new track
	* Added Settings module to manage settings shared across several
	  modules (more options need to be moved here)
	* Clear the track from track helper when stopping (frees some memory)
	* Clear statistic when starting a new activity
	* Fixed a couple of memory leaks in GpxParser
	* Added time zone conversions (whether or not to take  timezone into
	  account can be configured at the moment by using gconf; timezones
	  are ignored by default)
	* Save timezone into GPX
	* Fixed some references to be csecs (hundreths of seconds) instead of
	  msecs (milliseconds) as they were calculated
	* Fixed second fraction storing (leave trailing zeros, as XML Schema
	  definition requires this for dateTime type)
	* Parse second fraction even if it was only one digit long
	* Check better if time parsing fails using strptime
	* Fixed some memory leaks in the AnalyzerView (there was quite a large
	  memory leak with the graph pixbuf data)
	* Also fixed memory leaks with EcButton and EcProgressBar (the
	  pixbufs were incorrectly referenced as they are created with
	  refcount = 1)
	* For pixbufs, use g_object[un]ref instead of gdk_pixbuf[un]ref, as
	  that is recommended
	* In AnalyzerView, scroll the widget using g_idle_add (it helps to
	  reduce flicker as repaints have time to finish)
	* In AnalyzerView, fix a memory leak in expose event (the repaint
	  region rectangles were not freed)

2008-05-25  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed some issues with showing and hiding the AnalyzerView (there
	  were problems when leaving the view with the graphs view being
	  displayed)
	* Clear the track data when hiding the AnalyzerView

2008-05-25  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Changing name to "eCoach", part 2. Renamed all files that were
	  needed to, and did some small changes in some files, too
	  (Makefile.am files and some others)

2008-05-25  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Changing name to "eCoach", part 1. Changed (hopefully) all
	  references in source files from SportsTracker to eCoach,
	  SPT_* to EC_*, sportstracker to ecoach and so on. It is a bit
	  uncomfortable to work with simultaneous file renames and content
	  changes with svn, so no files were renamed yet.

2008-05-25  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* In AnalyzerView, draw the time scale. It does not work perfectly
	  (sometimes text overlaps, or the scale grid stops too early etc.),
	  but it is a bit difficult to create a sensible time scale (i.e.,
	  whole minutes for small durations and larger steps for larger
	  times)
	* Fixed the map legend text centering
	* Added a dialog to notify that only two graphs can be drawn at the
	  same time

2008-05-22  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Moved the heart rates to be stored the same way as way points - to
	  track segments. Now it is possible to pause/continue the heart rate
	  monitoring
	* Added util_compare_timevals function to compare time values
	* Changed track parsing/analyzing in AnalyzerView so that track
	  segments are stored separately. It required quit much changes, but
	  made the analyzis code more readable and enables more easily manage
	  track segments.
	* Fixed an old, unnoticed bug where the pause button did not change
	  to start button when continuing an activity
	* Also, in MapView, do not add heart rates to track during pause
	* Fixed a bug where prev variable was not set to NULL during the
	  second analyzis round
	* Check that bounds are set for altitude and heart rate, before trying
	  to draw them
	* Added function analyzer_view_create_scale that will draw all the
	  scales to reduce duplicated code
	* Fixed some bugs that prevented heart rate from being drawn correctly
	  

2008-05-22  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added heart speed, altitude and heart rate icons and background
	  image for small, pressed down button
	* Changed the mean interval count in beat detector to 20 to give
	  more stable heart rate readings
	* Fixed a crashing bug in beat detector callback removal (to_remove
	  variable was NULL and its members were tried to be accessed)
	* Changed beat detections to heart rates in MapView, TrackHelper,
	  GpxStorage and GpxParser. The heart rate timestamp and value are
	  stored in attributes, which makes more sense. XML schema was updated
	  to follow these changes. The purpose of this change is to support
	  in future other heart rate detectors (which usually send the heart
	  rate, not the individual beats). As a pleasant side effect, the
	  heart rate analysis gets easier and the sizes of the GPX files get
	  smaller
	* Parse heart rates in gpx parser and analyze them in AnalyzerView
	* Check the namespaces for the extensions node in GpxParser
	* Implemented graph toggling on/off in AnalyzerView
	* Show altitude graph in AnalyzerView
	* Several changes to drawing routines in AnalyzerView (they need to
	  be made more modular, though, because there is now a lot of
	  duplicated code). These changes include creation of scales (time
	  scale needs yet to be done) and map legend
	* In AnalyzerView, show track length as N/A instead of zero, if a
	  track contains no waypoints

2008-05-20  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed the multitrack functionality (allow to clear track helper
	  without destroying the already created tracks)
	* Implemented data clearing in AnalyzerView
	* A couple of fixes to track analyzis speed calculations
	* In analyzer view, implemented the track selection
	* Added checks for is_scrolling variable in the analyzer view to
	  make sure that nothing weird happens
	* Fixed a crash in AnalyzerView if the opened file contains no
	  tracks
	* Repaint the graph in AnalyzerView when data changes
	* In AnalyzerView, set the variable graphs_update_data to false
	  so that the data is not re-rendered on every expose event
	* In AnalyzerView, draw only the areas that are in the update region
	  (allows much faster repaints)
	* In AnalyzerView, don't draw a speed graph if the track duration
	  is zero

2008-05-19  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Moved the location_distance_between() function prototype fix into
	  a separate file
	* Changed track module to use struct timeval variables for time
	  calculations (it is more accurate than using millisecond
	  calculations and double precision numbers)
	* Fixed a bug in in track_helper_get_current_speed that caused the
	  calculation to return -1 when there were exactly five track points
	* Added to the GPX parser mechanism to detect the waypoint type
	  (track start etc)
	* Send track segment starts from the GPX parser (though this is unused
	  feature at the moment)
	* Some spelling changes
	* Added end time label to AnalyzerView
	* In AnalyzerView, created a new data type (AnalyzerViewTrack) that
	  is used when parsing a GPX file. It holds a list of the waypoints
	  (and soon of heart beats, too) and statistics about the track
	  such as duration and average speed.
	* Also created AnalyzerViewWaypoint which is quite similar to
	  GpxStorageWaypoint, except that it also contains the averaged
	  speed
	* Added AnalyzerViewColor that contains a color definition
	* Added AnalyzerViewPixbufDetails that will hold details for
	  creating a graph of a given track
	* Implemented the parsing results saving on the AnalyzerView side
	  (still requires more work, though, such as cleaning up before
	  changing to next file, and supporting different tracks etc.)
	* Implemented statics generation in AnalyzerView
	* Implemented graph display in AnalyzerView. It still needs to show
	  different types of information in addition to speed and draw the
	  scales. Also it needs more configurability.

2008-05-17  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Moved default folder change to interface module, and notify
	  ActivityChooser and AnalyzerView of default folder changes
	* Started work on the GPX parser using SAX parser of LibXML2 (most
	  of the track parsing is done; heart beat parsing and possibly
	  route parsing need yet to be done)
	* Implemented open dialog to AnalyzerView

2008-05-17  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added new graphics - mst_icon_open.png, mst_icon_track_next.png,
	  mst_icon_track_prev.png, mst_icon_arrow_left.png,
	  mst_icon_arrow_right.png, mst_button_change_view_bg.png,
	  mst_button_small_bg.png
	* Added analyzer view and created the UI for it (buttons, labels,
	  different views and scrolling)
	* Fixed a copy-paste error in the about dialog
	* Moved the GPX parser to a separate module and made many changes
	  to prepare the parsing of files (several new data types were defined)

2008-05-14  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Updated the ChangeLog of the map widget

2008-05-14  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* There were still typos with the text buffer. Now actually fixed
	  them...

2008-05-14  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed some of the copyright data in the about dialog
	* Fixed a gtk text buffer problem

2008-05-14  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added the COPYING file to svn
	* Added the README file to svn
	* Added menu_back_btn_icon.png, menu_generig_bg.png,
	  mst_icon_autocenter_on.png, mst_icon-autocenter_off.png and
	  mst_icon_heart_grey.png to svn
	* Added spt_style.rc to svn
	* Added the build dependencies for marshal.c and marshal.h to
	  Makefile.am and then marshal.c and marshal.h to BUILT_SOURCS in
	  Makfile.am (these fix automatic building of the sources)
	* Added to svn map_widget/ChangeLog and osea/ChangeLog
	* Added also the rest of the files from osea if they are later
	  needed (they are not included in the compilation; those files
	  are bxbep.c, easytest.c, inputs.h and qrsdet2.c)

2008-05-14  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added the map_view_stop function that will be called when closing
	  the program so that data will be written before closing
	* Stop the GPS and disconnect heart rate monitor when hiding the
	  map view in stopped state. This saves power.

2008-05-14  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added the -f switch to gtk-update-icon-cache in debin/postinst
	  (without the -f it does not seem to do anything)
	* Added hildon-fm-2 libraries and cflags
	* Added an icon to the back button
	* Added the arrow navigation to the map widget (required a new simple
	  function to the map widget - map_widget_center_onscreen_coords())
	* Added about dialog with copyright information
	* Made the start/stop activity code work much better (this was earlier
	  pretty much untested)
	* Moved the ...date_time_string_from_timeval to util
	* Added a new function, util_date_string_from_timeval which works like
	  the above function but returns only the date part
	* Added a track_helper_point_free function for completeness
	  (it only calls g_free on itself as there is not currently any
	  dynamically allocated data in it)
	* Ask for a file name when starting an activity. As default file name,
	  use "date - activity_name.gpx". Save the path as a default for next
	  time
	* Ask and save a comment for the activity (also fixed a related bug
	  in GpxStorage - it would use incorrectly SPT_GPX_NODE_TRACK_NAME
	  instead of SPT_GPX_NODE_TRACK_COMMENT if the comment node didn't
	  exist)
	* Added track_helper_clear function, which clears all track points
	  and statistics
	* Added gpx_storage_free function that closes the XML file
	* Fixed track storing. There was a bug that caused the track to
	  be saved as track 0 if there was exactly one track earlier with
	  an id 0
	* Added a "Searching satellites..." note that is shown when
	  establishing a GPX fix
	* Added map_view_get_activity_state function to map view
	* Some other small changes

2008-05-11  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added service and desktop files
	* Added icons (26x26 and scalable)
	* Added maemo-select-menu-location to postinst
	* Fixed the version in AC_INIT (configure.ac) to match the package
	  version
	* Removed the now obsolete "Show map view" menu item
	* Added possibility to choose whether or not to build EcgView
	* Confirm close on exit
	* Tuned the navigation menu button height so they fit more nicely to
	  the view
	* Center the navigation menu items if there are items only for one
	  line
	* Fixed the calculation for whether or not the scroll bar is required
	  in navigation menu; also disable the scroll bar after it is not
	  needed anymore
	* Removed some commented-out code

2008-05-10  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added function to start activity in interface instead of just
	  showing the map view. The activity navigation is disabled for
	  now.
	* Added activity chooser that will input the name and heart rate
	  interval for a new exercise
	* Save the track name and comment to GPX files
	* Rewrote the activity module (it was unused anyway)
	* Fixed a bug in gpx module (it didn't save coordinates because the
	  g_ascii_dtostr would write to dbuf variable instead of buf)
	* Changed the heart rate ranges to be a simple range. Now the icon
	  shows whether the heart rate is good (green), too low (red) or too
	  high (yellow).
	* The TargetHeartRate module is now "ready" (it was almost completely
	  rewritten)
	* Added HeartRateSettings module that handles heart rate range
	  interaction with GConf

2008-05-06  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed the autocenter functionality of the map widget
	* Added icons for the autocenter button
	* Added grey heart icon for the case when the heart rate monitor
	  is not connected
	* MapView layout work is now almost complete (the buttons are not
	  yet configurable, though)
	* Started work on the target heart rate ranges wizard
	* Added secondary user data pointer to the callbacks of the
	  GConfHelper - it eases many cases when there are several similar
	  settings that need to be easily distinguished
	* Draw the icon in a fixed place in SptButton when there is a title
	  and a label (prevents the icon from bouncing around)
	* Change the heart rate icon according to the heart rate (this needs
	  more work and reading configuration from GConf)

2008-05-05  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Started the implementation of the new graphics to the map view
	* Divided some graphics files in pieces
	* Added a default navigation button background
	* SptProgress graphics code rewritten
	* Added the possibility for using both title and label in SptButton
	  (caused several changes to the code of the SptButton)
	* In hrm_settings, unref the proxy_con_dialog only if it is non-NULL
	  (prevent GLib warning in some cases)
	* Some other small changes

2008-04-28  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Moved the main notebook to navigation menu. Now the navigation
	  bar can be (and is) shown all the time.

2008-04-28  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added background for the navigation bar
	* Added close and minimize buttons to the navigation bar

2008-04-28  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Implemented setting graphics for the navigation menu buttons
	* Reordered the navigation menu a bit
	* Changed the navigation menu button sizes
	* Actually use the buttons_per_display parameter in the navigation
	  menu
	* Added functions to add background and icon as pixbufs to the
	  SptButton (increases performance because the images don't need to
	  be reloaded every time)
	* Center the graphics in SptButton

2008-04-27  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added RC file and some theming to it
	* Added SptButton class that can display background image and a text.
	  In future, also a button-specific image will be supported so that
	  the image does not need to be embedded in teh background graphics.
	* Added font description and alignment settings to navigation menu
	* Show the application in full screen all time (close and minimize
	  buttons are yet to be added)
	* Save also beat type into GPX files
	* Removed unnecessary beat count calculation from beat_detect module
	* Fixed heart rate calculation
	* For debugging, indent the XML output
	* Some small documentation and comment changes

2008-04-23  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added possibility for showing certain error messages only once
	  (user can click on a "do not show this message again" checkbox)
	* Put heart beat simulation function declarations inside #if #endif
	  block
	* Use current date and time for the name of the track (this needs
	  more work, though, because the directory is not still configurable,
	  and file names contain now colons, and therefore can't be copied
	  to MMCs that have FAT32 file system)
	* Added timestamps into GPX files
	* Store all timestamps in the local time (the timezone data itself
	  is not yet saved). This probably should be made user-configurable.
	* Fixed time formats (the tm struct has quite weird specifications
	  - months are stored from 0 to 11, while dates of month are stored
	  as 1 to 31, and year as year-1900)
	* Print coordinates into GPX files using locale-independent function
	  (g_strdup_printf uses locales, and might therefore use comma in
	  a coordinate, which would not work in GPX parsers)
	* Added functions to easily set and get values from GConf without using
	  callbacks in GConf helper module
	* Store heart beat data and location to GPX file only when activity is
	  in started state
	* Some documentation fixes
	* Added Doxygen file and doc directory
	* Some other small changes

2008-04-22  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added a simple heart beat simulation
	* Changed the GPS simulation to be defined via TRUE/FALSE mechanism
	  instead of ifdef/ifndef
	* Added timestamps to heart beats, and pass those to callbacks
	* Added track autosaving (it is not configurable yet)
	* Save heart beat to GPX files as a custom extension
	* Insert the GPX extension schema definition URI correctly to the
	  xsi schemaLocation attribute, not to spt
	* Some other small changes to GPX file handling
	* Added xml_util module, which eases some XML related tasks (find and
	  add child nodes in different ways and converts struct timevals to
	  XML dateTime type)
	* Fixed the track and route searching (forgot to take the return value
	  from g_slist_next())
	* Added a printf style function for showing error messages in
	  spt_error module
	* Several small documentation and comment changes
	* Fixed a bug when searching through track IDs and route IDs
	  (there was an infinite loop if the first track wasn't the correct
	  one)
	* Include the custom schema in the written gpx documents

2008-04-19  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added new graphics to svn (they are not yet used, and the code
	  using the old graphics needs to be updated)

2008-04-19  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Actually added the custom schema to svn

2008-04-19  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added a custom extension schema for the inclusion of heart beat
	  detection to the saved gpx files
	* Added track saving (currently saves to a default file); saves only
	  on a track stop
	* Automatically save paused segments as track sections
	* Fixed a bug of not using the track id correctly
	* Fixed the waypoint longitude attribute name (it is not "long", but
	  "lon")
	* Track helper has now a state (paused, stopped, started) instead of
	  just boolean is_started
	* Added the xmlDocSetRootElement to gpx.c (otherwise the saved XML
	  file would have been empty)
	* Removed the route_track_id from the parameters of
	  gpx_storage_add_waypoint (the route_track_id is already in the
	  waypoint parameter)
	* Add a new track segment also with GPX_STORAGE_POINT_TYPE_TRACK_START
	* Set speed to zero when pausing activity

2008-04-16  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added LibXML2
	* New error domains for file handling and parsing
	* Added gpx.c, gpx_defs.h and gpx.h for strogin the track data
	  in gpx format (compiles, but for now otherwise untested)

2008-04-04  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added a TrackHelper module to clean up the code in the MapView.
	  The track helper manages the track information (track points,
	  distance calculations, speed and average speed, elapsed time).
	* Moved most of the tracking code from MapView to TrackHelper
	* Added current speed and average speed calculations
	* Tuned the GPS filtering

2008-03-26  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added a prototype for location_distance_between(), because the
	  one defined in the location/location-distance-utils is errorneous
	  and fails compilation
	* Added tracking
	* Added calculation of travelled distance
	* Added GPS simulation for testing purposes
	* Added functionality for toggling autocenter on/off
	* Don't disconnect from GPS and heart rate monitor when only hiding
	  the map view

2008-03-24  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Listen and use GPS data in map view
	* Added back button to map view
	* Added timer functionality to map view (with start/pause
	  functionality)
	* Added util_substract_time() and util_add_time() functions to
	  util module
	* Added _DEBUG_PRINT_MESSAGE macro to debug module to print a debug
	  message always
	* Added DEBUG_NOT_IMPLEMENTED macro to print a warning of
	  unimplemented functions
	* Added some buttons and stub functions to map view
	* Configure the map view only once during a program run (prevents
	  a lock-up when reshowing map view)
	* Set the autocenter of the map widget only when there is a GPS fix
	  (otherwise the default locatino would be wrong)
	* Prevent setting zoom level beyond the zoom level boundaries (1 and
	  17)
	* In ecg_data module, bail out in removing callbacks if there aren't
	  any registered (this prevents errorneous disconnect trial)

2008-03-16  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added missing gfx directory and files under it to svn

2008-03-16  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added missing spt_error.[c,h] files to svn

2008-03-15  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed configure.ac yet again (forgot a backward slash before -Wall)
	* Added MapWidget to the source tree
	* Added MapWidget to MapView
	* Added zoom in / zoom out to MapView

2008-03-11  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Return TRUE on success in ecg_data_setup_serial_pipe()

2008-03-11  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed a large amount of compiler warnings. These were ignored,
	  because the -Wall option was originally only for autotools,
	  not for the compiler (fixed this).

2008-03-11  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added spt_error module to be able to handle errors via the
	  GError system
	* Also added a simple error dialog to spt_error to simplify showing
	  error messages
	* Enhanced error handling of EcgData and other modules using it
	  (among others, user is now shown an error dialog of Bluetooth
	  errors etc)
	* Added a callback system to BeatDetector
	* Beat detector now uses EcgData directly (i.e, it needs no longer to
	  be manually fed the ECG signal)
	* Added parameter request functions to EcgData
	* Confiugre beat detector parameters directly from EcgData
	* Beat detector calculates heart rate as a mean value from several
	  beat intervals (the amount of beat intervals to calculate is
	  configurable)
	* Map view uses beat detector now
	* Fixed the SPT_PROGRESS_GOAL_MIN and SPT_PROGRESS_GOAL_CENTER modes
	  to get the state properly
	* Several function documentation changes and improvements

2008-03-10  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Moved the DATADIR definition from configure.ac to Makefile.am, thus
	  not requiring any workarounds for Autoconf

2008-03-10  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added a SptProgress. It introduces once again GObject classing to
	  the project by using Gob2 to do the dirty work (i.e., GObject
	  subclassing).
	* Added a graphics directory and some Autoconf work-arounds to get
	  the DATADIR macro defined for source codes
	* Started work on the map view

2008-03-06  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Removed the GObject classing. It causes way too much work when
	  compared to the gained advantage

2008-03-03  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Implemented a new base class for the views so that different kinds
	  of views can be easily created and interaction with them will be
	  easy

2008-03-03  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed the callbacks for the ECG data (they weren't called at all
	  after the major changes)
	* Send the data to callbacks as a guchar* pointer without an
	  offset, this makes the code much cleaner and easier to maintain
	* Added a back button to ECG view, but it does not yet do anything.
	  The wisest thing for the views would be to subclass them in Glib
	  way, as they are now merely structs and related functions.

	* Moved the Bluetooth handling code from ecg_view to ecg_data, where
	  it belongs
	* Improved handling of some error situations in the Bluetooth
	  connection
	* Added support for multiple simultaneous clients for EcgData
	* Handle bluetooth connection closing properly
	* Changed the byte comparisons from the buffer to use integers,
	  not gchars
	* Note however, that even though the code compiles, it is not yet
	  tested

2008-02-28  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Removed unneeded code from ecg_view.c and ecg_view.h

2008-02-26  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Some files imported from the OSEA library. They were modified
	  to accommodate the 300 Hz sampling rate.
	* Beat detection from the ECG data (the code needs some working,
	  and does not yet analyse live data, but that's easy to change)
	* Don't get the return value for the Show ECG menu item, as it is not
	  needed

2008-02-21  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Switched to a socket based Bluetooth communication. This fixed
	  the missing bytes problem.
	* Fixed some issues with the data parsing (data chunk sequence
	  number was being wrongly extracted, and so was event flag)
	* Fixed problems with the painting. Signed integers were used
	  when unsigned were the right ones to use. Also, drawing area
	  clearing was done incorrectly (when passing the edge, too much
	  area was cleared).
	* Added a cursor to the EcgView painting.
	* Added function to free the unused voltage data from memory
	* The Bluetooth code from the EcgView needs to be moved to a
	  separate module
	* Added ChangeLog to version control (for some reason it was missing)

2008-02-18  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added a missing gconf_keys.h to repository
	* Data fetching sort of works. However, there seem to be a lot
	  of missing bytes (i.e., the data arrives corrupted), and this
	  needs further study. Otherwise, the ECG drawing works now,
	  even though it is very simple and hardcoded at the moment.

2008-02-08  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Removed some unnecessary widgets from AppData struct
	* Added ecg_view and ecg_data modules. These will change a lot,
	  but will form the basis for the bluetooth communication and
	  ECG data interpretation

2008-01-30  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Fixed some bugs in the GConf wrapper that were revealed after
	  really using it.
	* Use the GConf wrapper for bluetooth address and bluetooth name
	  storing.

2008-01-30  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Implemented GConf wrapper that works around several major obstacles
	  in the GConf architechture (at least type stability,
	  key-specific callbacks, checking if the value actually was
	  changed). This is so far untested (except for compilation).	  

2008-01-27  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Implemented device selection (the selected device is not yet
	  stored anywhere, but that should be quite trivial compared to
	  the device selection launching)

2008-01-26  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Preliminary DBus initializations
	* Added gthread library and initialization
	* Fixed compilation

2008-01-26  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Implemented menu system

2008-01-15  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* First stub version that compiles correctly (only a hello-world)
	* Added debian packaging
	* Added Gtk libraries
