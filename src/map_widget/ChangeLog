	* Added function to clear track
	* Fixed several compiler warnings that were caused using
	  g_return_if_fail instead of g_return_val_if_fail

2008-05-14  Jukka Alasalmi <jualasal@mail.student.oulu.fi>
	* Added functions map_widget_get_autocenter_status() and
	  map_widget_center_onscreen_coords()
	* Removed debugging from the map widget by defining g_debug(...) to
	  none
	* In function map_widget_get_maptile(), removed the first
	  maptile = g_strdup(reval.value.s), because retval was undefined at
	  that point, and the same thing was done after the
	  osso_rpc_run, too
